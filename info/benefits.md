# OpenPass Benefits for Publishers and Consumers

OpenPass offers many benefits, including the following:

* [Benefits for Publishers](#benefits-for-publishers)
* [Benefits for Consumers](#benefits-for-consumers)

## Benefits for Publishers

OpenPass offers a streamlined way for publishers to increase authenticated users on their sites. With OpenPass, publishers can easily integrate with UID2 and give consumers a one-click way to sign in. By increasing authenticated users, publishers can also make sure they can continue reaching consumers when existing technology, such as third-party cookies, is not available. 

If a site doesn't yet collect consumer emails, OpenPass offers these benefits:

* Adding OpenPass is a way to add authentication and start collecting consumer information, without adding infrastructure such as secure storage of user email and password information.
* It allows publishers to monetize content through relevant advertising without relying on third-party cookies.
* Publishers can focus on what they do best&#8212;creating great content&#8212;and also have control over the user experience on their sites, with minimal overhead.

If a site already collects consumer email addresses through a sign-in experience or other SSO options, such as login with Google or Facebook, OpenPass adds these benefits:

* It offers consumers an additional option that better protects their privacy by sharing just their email or advertising token, instead of sharing a set of profile data.
*  Publishers have an SSO option outside the traditional "walled garden" SSO login options.


## Benefits for Consumers

Consumers have increasing concern about their privacy and the ways in which their information is shared. OpenPass offers a simple and streamlined SSO option with no link to social media accounts and no password to manage or remember. For consumers, it's simple, secure, and streamlined.

Benefits for consumers include the following:

* A streamlined sign-up process with no password required.
* The ability to access multiple sites that support OpenPass, without multiple logins. At each subsequent site, the user chooses their OpenPass account, and then passes on to view the content. There is no need to create a new account with each publisher or platform, as long as the publisher supports OpenPass.

To sign in to a site with OpenPass for the first time, the consumer does the following:

  1. Enters an email address.
  2. Retrieves a six-digit validation code sent to the email address.
  3. Enters the validation code in the sign-in window.

After the first sign in, the consumer can return to the site and access content without having to sign in again.
